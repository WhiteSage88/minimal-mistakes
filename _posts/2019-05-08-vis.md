# Stockton's Vega Inventory System

In an effort to give back to the institution that gave me the opportunity of doing my masters (the NAMS department specificially), I began to work on a <b>Flask/SQL</b> web app in order to address one of our critical needs. Our inventory system at the time, Vertere, was outdated (purchased 2004) and on servers that had critical security issues. IT had informed us that we needed to find another program to replace this. I jumped on the opportunity to create something that would meet our needs which included: 
<br>
Barcode Tagging
<br>
Custom Fields 
<br>
Multi-User Functionality and Role Separation

I began my work around November 2016 (I remember traveling to my family with laptop in hand and working on the framework for the website at Thanksgiving). I was given a deadline of February 29th 2017 by my supervisor. I worked hard and quick in order to learn <b>mySQL</b> and <b>HTML/Flask</b>. I used these because they were free, cost-effective options compared to buying a program that could cost us $20k+. Plus, it forced me to learn more <b>Python</b> and <b>SQL</b>, both good skills to have. 

As with any projects, there were hold-ups. I presented the packaged program to other departments but got denied several times because I was the only one with the knowledge of python. Eventually, they accepted and loaded the program up December 2018 because the server was needed to be shut down soon. 

I was able to provide all initial needs of the department and am now adding small features to the website such as a digital database of SDS's for all chemicals housed within the facilities.
