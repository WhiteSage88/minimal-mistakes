<h1>SDS Scrape for NJ RTK Compliance</h1> 

Beginning in March 2018, Stockton University recieved a surprise inspection by the New Jersey Right-to-Know (NJ-RTK) department
of the Department of Health. This deparment insures compliance of institutions in relation to workers and their environments.
I was to oversee what corrections needed to be done to be in or exceed compliance in the Unified Science Center, F-Wing and 
The Arts and Sciences Building. We were not in risk of being cited but recommendations were given to be corrected by the time 
the inspector returned. Most of them were just "Label XYZ chemical in this location" which was a small recommendation since all
it took was just writing up a label on the spot. The big project which I wrote a program for was to make sure EVERY SDS binder
in EVERY room in ALL buildings was filled with the chemicals each room housed.
<br>
This was a huge undertaking because not only did we need to check every binder but also locate the SDS for every chemical on
file.

<h3>Background Info</h3>
Safety Data Sheet(SDS) is a multi-page report for every chemical any manufacturer produces.
This was printed out by either the manufacturer and sent with the chemical or printed out by the reciever here at Stockton if 
the SDS wasn't supplied.

Our inventory system at the time was Vertere. We purchased the system around 2006 and had been using it to tag and store information
of any chemical that came and left at Stockton.
