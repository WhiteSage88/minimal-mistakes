# Classification of Eye Movement Patterns in Heroes of the Storm

I play video games. A lot of different kinds. RPGs, shooters, ARPGs and MOBAs. The acronyms don't really matter but just that
their play styles are all different. One game in particular caught my attention, Heroes of the Storm (HotS) which is a MOBA 
(Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) where two teams of five take control of a particular character and battle against each other 
on differing maps. One unique thing that sets HotS apart from other MOBAs is the gameplay style certain charcters have. Three 
in particular come to mind as far as where I am looking on the screen. Abathur, Brightwing and The Lost Vikings.

Abathur's playstyle revolves around a passive gameplay. The character's body does not physically play a role in the game.
